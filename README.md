#his home‑automation task merges a sophisticated browser interface with an Arduino‑based circuit so users can control household devices over Bluetooth. The objective is to deliver a showroom‑grade dashboard that toggles lights, fans, air‑conditioners, and smart locks instantly while remaining entirely open source. Combining modern Web standards, maker‑friendly electronics, and minimal wiring produces an ideal capstone for engineering students, hobbyists, and educators seeking a tangible, visually striking showcase of the Internet‑of‑Things concept that is real‑world and an instructive proof of concept.
